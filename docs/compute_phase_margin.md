This function `compute_phase_margin` is designed to extract the **phase margin** of an amplifier or feedback system by analyzing the **AC simulation output** generated by **ngspice**.

### üîß Context: What is Phase Margin?

In analog design, **phase margin (PM)** is a key stability metric for feedback amplifiers. It measures how close the phase of the loop gain is to -180¬∞ at the frequency where the **gain crosses 0 dB (i.e., unity gain)**. If the phase margin is too small, the amplifier is prone to ringing or even oscillation.

---

### üß™ Purpose of the Function

This function reads an ngspice **AC analysis output logfile** (formatted as frequency + complex voltage values), then:

1.  **Parses frequency response (gain and phase)**.
    
2.  **Finds the frequency where the gain is 0 dB**.
    
3.  **Determines the phase margin based on the phase at this frequency**.
    

---

### üß† Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1\. **Read AC Simulation Data**

```python
data_ac = np.genfromtxt(logfile, skip_header=1)
```

Assumes the logfile is a text file with columns like:

```scss
freq  real(vout)  imag(vout)     # for single-ended output (3 columns)
freq  real(...) imag(...) real(vout) imag(vout)   # for differential output (6 columns)
```

#### 2\. **Extract Output Voltage (`v_d`)**

```python
if num_columns == 3:
    v_d = data_ac[:, 1] + 1j * data_ac[:, 2]
elif num_columns == 6:
    v_d = data_ac[:, 4] + 1j * data_ac[:, 5]
```

This reconstructs the **complex voltage** from the real and imaginary parts.

---

#### 3\. **Compute Gain and Phase**

```python
gain_db = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_d))
phase = np.degrees(np.angle(v_d))
```

-   Gain in dB: standard formula `20 * log10(magnitude)`
    
-   Phase: `angle(v_d)` converted to degrees
    

---

#### 4\. **Find Unity-Gain Frequency (0 dB)**

```python
index_at_0_dB = np.argmin(np.abs(gain_db - 0))
frequency_at_0_dB = frequency[index_at_0_dB]
phase_at_0_dB = phase[index_at_0_dB]
```

This finds the index where the gain is closest to 0 dB. Then it extracts the corresponding **phase at that frequency**.

---

#### 5\. **Determine Initial Phase**

```python
initial_phase = phase[0]
```

This is used to infer the topology:

-   If phase starts near **180¬∞**, it assumes an **inverting amplifier**.
    
-   If near **0¬∞**, assumes **non-inverting**.
    

#### 6\. **Compute Phase Margin**

```python
if np.isclose(initial_phase, 180, atol=tolerance):
    return phase_at_0_dB
elif np.isclose(initial_phase, 0, atol=tolerance):
    return 180 - np.abs(phase_at_0_dB)
else:
    return 0
```

-   If initial phase ‚âà 0¬∞:
    
    $$
    \text{Phase Margin} = 180^\circ - |\text{Phase at 0 dB}|
    $$
    
-   If initial phase ‚âà 180¬∞:
    
    $$
    \text{Phase Margin} = \text{Phase at 0 dB} \quad (\text{already relative to 180¬∞})
    $$
    
-   If the initial phase doesn't match either: returns 0 (invalid condition).

### ‚úÖ Use Case Example

1.  Run an AC analysis in ngspice:
    
    ```scss
    .ac dec 100 1Hz 1GHz
    .print ac V(out)
    ```
    
2.  Redirect output to a logfile using `-r` or by printing to a file.
    
3.  Use this Python function on the saved log:
    
    ```python
    pm = compute_phase_margin("ac_output.log")
    print(f"Phase Margin = {pm:.2f} degrees")
    ```
    

---

### üìù Assumptions & Limitations

-   Works only for **single-loop gain responses**.
    
-   Assumes the output node(s) are printed as voltage in the correct format.
    
-   Assumes phase response starts near 0¬∞ or 180¬∞ to classify topology.
    
-   Only checks **closest sample** to 0 dB ‚Äî no interpolation.
    

---

### üìå Summary

This function helps you **automatically extract phase margin** from ngspice AC simulations by:

-   Parsing frequency response from log
    
-   Identifying unity-gain frequency
    
-   Extracting phase at that frequency
    
-   Estimating PM based on system's phase orientation
    

Let me know if you want a version that handles interpolated 0 dB crossing or works directly from raw `.raw` files using `PySpice`.

You: 

Why the formula 20 \* np.log10(np.abs(v\_d)) can give the gain in dB, should it be calaculated with V\_in, V\_out instead of just using V\_d ?

ChatGPT: 

Great question ‚Äî you're absolutely right to raise this! Let's break it down carefully:

---

### üîß Short Answer:

Yes ‚Äî **gain** in dB should ideally be computed as:

$$
\text{Gain (dB)} = 20 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \left| \frac{V_{\text{out}}}{V_{\text{in}}} \right| \right)
$$

But in the context of your function, it works **only because of a specific assumption**:  
üß† **It assumes** that **`V_in` is 1V (unit magnitude)** in the AC simulation.

---

### üí° How AC Analysis in SPICE Works

In an `.ac` simulation, SPICE performs **small-signal linear analysis** around the operating point. This is different from transient simulation. Most importantly:

-   You **excite** the circuit with a **small AC signal**, e.g.,
    
    ```nginx
    Vin in 0 AC 1
    ```
    
-   This injects an AC signal with magnitude = 1V (or 1A for current sources).
    

In this case:

$$
V_{\text{in}} = 1 \angle 0^\circ \Rightarrow |V_{\text{in}}| = 1
$$

So, the gain simplifies to:

$$
\left| \frac{V_{\text{out}}}{1} \right| = |V_{\text{out}}| \Rightarrow \text{Gain (dB)} = 20 \cdot \log_{10}(|V_{\text{out}}|)
$$

That‚Äôs why the function uses:

```python
gain_db = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_d))
```

It works **if and only if the AC source magnitude is 1**.

---

### üß™ If the AC source magnitude ‚â† 1?

Then you would **need to divide by the input**:

```python
gain_db = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_out / v_in))
```

So if your `.ac` source was defined like this:

```nginx
Vin in 0 AC 10
```

Then:

$$
\text{Gain (dB)} = 20 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{|V_{\text{out}}|}{10} \right)
$$

---

### ‚úÖ Best Practice (if unsure about input magnitude):

If you're writing a more robust version of the function, it‚Äôs better to:

1.  Parse both `V(in)` and `V(out)` from the simulation output.
    
2.  Then compute:
    

```python
gain_db = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_out / v_in))
```

But if your netlist uses:

```spice
Vin in 0 AC 1
```

Then it's fine to just use:

```python
gain_db = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_out))
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

-   The formula `20 * log10(abs(v_d))` is **valid only if** the AC input signal has **magnitude 1**.
    
-   In SPICE AC analysis, this is often the default (`AC 1`).
    
-   If the input magnitude is not 1, or if you want a general-purpose function, you must include both `V_out` and `V_in` in the calculation.
    

Would you like help modifying the function to include `V_in` explicitly?

You: 

Is this still true even if the input is defined as follows ? \* A DC voltage source named \[Vcm\] is applied between node cm and ground. \* Its value is set using the parameter Vcm = 0.9. Vcm cm 0 DC {Vcm} \* This setup injects a differential signal into the gates of M4 and M3 while maintaining a common-mode level of Vcm = 0.9V. Eidp cm in1 diffin 0 1 Eidn cm in2 diffin 0 -1 \* AC magnitude = 1 (used for AC analysis) \* SINE waveform: amplitude = 1 ŒºV, frequency = 10 kHz (rest are 0) Vid diffin 0 AC 1 SIN (0 1u 10k 0 0)

ChatGPT: 

Yes ‚Äî even **with this setup**, the formula `20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_d))` is **still valid** for computing gain in dB ‚Äî **under AC analysis**, **because the AC magnitude is defined as 1** in your voltage source:

```spice
Vid diffin 0 AC 1 SIN (0 1u 10k 0 0)
```

Let's explain **why** this works and **what matters** in your setup.

---

### üîç Key Idea: AC and Transient Sources Are Handled Separately

In SPICE, the source definition:

```spice
Vid diffin 0 AC 1 SIN(0 1u 10k 0 0)
```

contains both:

-   `AC 1` ‚Üí **AC analysis magnitude** (used in `.ac` simulations)
    
-   `SIN(...)` ‚Üí **Transient analysis signal** (used in `.tran` simulations)
    

But:

> üß† During **AC analysis**, SPICE **ignores the SIN() part**. It only uses the `AC 1`.

So for `.ac` analysis, SPICE behaves as if you had written:

```spice
Vid diffin 0 AC 1
```

That means:

-   The input AC signal at `diffin` has **magnitude = 1 V**, **phase = 0¬∞**
    
-   Therefore:
    
    $$
    \left| \frac{V_{\text{out}}}{V_{\text{in}}} \right| = |V_{\text{out}}| \quad \text{(since } |V_{\text{in}}| = 1)
    $$
    

---

### ‚úÖ Your Special Configuration

You use a differential input via voltage-controlled voltage sources (VCVS):

```spice
Eidp cm in1 diffin 0 1
Eidn cm in2 diffin 0 -1
```

This creates a differential excitation:

-   `in1 = cm + Vid`
    
-   `in2 = cm - Vid`
    

So:

-   Differential input = `in1 - in2 = 2 * Vid`
    

However, in AC analysis:

-   `Vid = 1 ‚à†0¬∞` (magnitude 1)
    
-   So `in1 - in2 = 2 ‚à†0¬∞`
    

Thus:

-   **Differential input = 2V (AC magnitude)**
    

So your actual input magnitude is **2 V**, not 1 V.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Correction Needed for Your Case

Since your differential input results in a **2 V input**, the formula should be:

```python
gain_db = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_out) / 2)
```

Otherwise, you‚Äôre **overestimating the gain by 6 dB**.

---

### üéØ Summary for Your Setup

| Component | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| `Vid diffin 0 AC 1` | Injects **1 V AC** signal at `diffin` |
| `Eidp`, `Eidn` | Create a **2 V differential signal** (`in1 - in2 = 2 * Vid`) |
| Effective AC input | 2 V differential input |
| Therefore | You **must divide by 2** to get the correct gain |

So the **correct formula in your case is:**

```python
gain_db = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_out) / 2)
```

Let me know if you'd like to update your function to support this automatically.

You: 

is it true that we only have only input (diffin) and the magnitute is still be 1 ?

ChatGPT: 

Excellent question ‚Äî and you're absolutely right to clarify this subtle point. Let‚Äôs walk through this carefully.

---

## ‚úÖ Short Answer:

In your SPICE setup, **you have only one AC input source** (`Vid` at node `diffin`), and **its AC magnitude is 1 V**.  
**That means:**

$$
|V_{\text{in, AC}}| = 1~\text{V}
$$

Even though the signal ends up being applied **differentially** to the gates of M3 and M4 through the `Eidp` and `Eidn` VCVS elements, the actual **AC excitation** still originates from a **single source with AC magnitude 1 V** ‚Äî and that is what SPICE uses when computing the small-signal response.

---

## üîç Deep Dive: Understanding Your Setup

Here‚Äôs your AC source and VCVS configuration again:

```spice
Vid diffin 0 AC 1 SIN(0 1u 10k 0 0)   ; AC source = 1V
Eidp cm in1 diffin 0 1               ; in1 = cm + Vid
Eidn cm in2 diffin 0 -1              ; in2 = cm - Vid
```

### How this works:

-   `Vid` injects a **1V AC** signal at `diffin`.
    
-   `Eidp` and `Eidn` use that signal to create a **differential drive**:
    
    -   `in1 = cm + Vid`
        
    -   `in2 = cm - Vid`
        
-   So:
    
    $$
    V_{\text{in1}} - V_{\text{in2}} = 2 \cdot V_{\text{Vid}}
    $$
     
    $$
    \Rightarrow V_{\text{diff}} = 2 \cdot \text{(AC input)}
    $$
    

So yes ‚Äî **your actual differential excitation becomes 2 V** (peak), but **SPICE still sees the AC input source as 1 V**, because that‚Äôs the source definition.

---

## üß† What's the Right Gain Reference?

Now the question becomes:

> When we compute gain as $\frac{V_{\text{out}}}{V_{\text{in}}}$, what is $V_{\text{in}}$?

That depends on how you're **measuring**:

-   If you're measuring the **output response to `Vid`**, then yes:
    
    $$
    \text{Gain (dB)} = 20 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \left| \frac{V_{\text{out}}}{V_{\text{Vid}}} \right| \right) = 20 \cdot \log_{10} (|V_{\text{out}}|), \text{ since } |V_{\text{Vid}}| = 1
    $$
    
-   But if you're interpreting the gain as the ratio of **output to differential gate voltage (`in1 - in2`)**, then the input is effectively 2 V, and you must divide by 2.
    

---

## üéØ So Which Is Correct?

Both are valid ‚Äî it depends on your **definition of input**:

| Interpretation | Input magnitude | Formula for gain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input is `Vid` | 1 V | \`20 \* log10( |
| Input is differential gate (`in1 - in2`) | 2 V | \`20 \* log10( |

So:

-   ‚úÖ If your definition of gain is relative to **Vid**, the function as written is **correct**.
    
-   ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're thinking of gain from the perspective of **differential input applied to the circuit**, then you must divide by 2.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Recommendation

Just be consistent in your interpretation of **what input you're referencing** when interpreting gain/phase margin.
