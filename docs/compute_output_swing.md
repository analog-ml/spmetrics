# NGSpice Output Swing Calculation

```spice
.control
    dc Vin1 0 1.8 0.0001
    wrdata output_dc_ow.dat out in1
.endc
```

```python
data_dc = np.genfromtxt(logfile, skip_header=1)
output = data_dc[0:,1]
in1 = data_dc[0:,3]
d_output_d_in1 = np.gradient(output, in1)

# Replace zero or near-zero values with a small epsilon to avoid log10(0) error
epsilon = 1e-10
d_output_d_in1 = np.where(np.abs(d_output_d_in1) < epsilon, epsilon, d_output_d_in1)

```

This NGSpice + Python code combination is used to **compute the output swing (OW)** of an analog circuit ‚Äî typically an amplifier ‚Äî by analyzing how the output voltage varies as the input voltage is swept and measuring the range over which the circuit maintains **sufficient gain** (at least 80% of mid-band gain).

---

### **Step-by-step Breakdown**

---

### üîß **NGSpice Code**

```spice
.control
  dc Vin1 0 1.8 0.0001
  wrdata output_dc_ow.dat out in1
.endc
```

-   This performs a **DC sweep** of the input voltage source `Vin1` from 0‚ÄØV to 1.8‚ÄØV in 0.1‚ÄØmV steps.
    
-   For each input voltage step, NGSpice records the output voltage (`out`) and the swept input voltage (`in1`).
    
-   The results are written to the file `output_dc_ow.dat`.
    

---

### üêç **Python Code**

Assume:

```python
logfile = "output_dc_ow.dat"
```

#### ‚úÖ **1\. Load the Sweep Data**

```python
data_dc = np.genfromtxt(logfile, skip_header=1)
```

-   Reads the `.dat` file into a NumPy array.
    
-   Skips the first line (header).
    

```python
output = data_dc[0:,1]  # Output voltage 'out'
in1 = data_dc[0:,3]     # Input voltage 'in1'
```

-   `output`: output voltage values.
    
-   `in1`: corresponding input voltage values.
    

---

#### ‚úÖ **2\. Compute Gain as dVout/dVin**

```python
d_output_d_in1 = np.gradient(output, in1)
```

-   Uses NumPy to compute the derivative of output voltage with respect to input ‚Äî an approximation of **gain**.
    

```python
epsilon = 1e-10
d_output_d_in1 = np.where(np.abs(d_output_d_in1) < epsilon, epsilon, d_output_d_in1)
gain = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(d_output_d_in1))
```

-   Applies a small epsilon to prevent `log10(0)` errors.
    
-   Gain is expressed in **dB**: $\text{Gain(dB)} = 20 \log_{10}(\left|\frac{dV_{\text{out}}}{dV_{\text{in}}}\right|)$
    

---

#### ‚úÖ **3\. Identify Midpoint Gain**

```python
max_index = np.where(in1 == 0.9)
```

-   Finds the index where `Vin1 = 0.9V` (typically mid-rail in a 1.8‚ÄØV system).
    

```python
gain_mid = gain[index]
```

-   Gets the **gain at mid-input** voltage, assumed to be the **reference point** (mid-band gain).
    

---

#### ‚úÖ **4\. Compute Output Swing (OW)**

```python
indices = np.where(gain > 0.8 * gain_mid)
output_above_threshold = output[indices]
```

-   Extracts output values where gain ‚â• 80% of mid-band gain.
    
-   This approximates the **linear region** of the amplifier where it still maintains acceptable gain.
    

```python
vout_first = output_above_threshold[0]
vout_last = output_above_threshold[-1]
ow = vout_first - vout_last
```

-   Calculates the **output swing**: the voltage difference between the highest and lowest output voltages in the high-gain region.
    

---

### ‚úÖ **What is Output Swing (OW)?**

-   It is the **range of output voltages** over which the amplifier maintains sufficient gain ‚Äî i.e., operates **linearly**.
    
-   High output swing is desired in amplifiers because it allows larger signal amplitudes without distortion.

## üìò Theoretical Explanation: **How to Compute Output Swing in Analog Circuits**

---

### ‚úÖ **What Is Output Swing?**

**Output swing** refers to the **range of output voltages** that an analog circuit (especially an amplifier) can produce **while operating linearly and maintaining acceptable performance** (e.g., gain, distortion, etc.).

-   In amplifiers, the output cannot swing from rail to rail (e.g., 0‚ÄØV to VDD) due to **saturation and cutoff limits** of transistors.
    
-   Instead, the **usable output swing** is defined within a range where the amplifier still maintains:
    
    -   Good gain (often within 80‚Äì90% of peak gain)
        
    -   Acceptable linearity (no significant distortion)
        
    -   Transistors remain in proper operating regions (e.g., saturation)
        

---

### üìê **Types of Output Swing**

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Full Output Swing** | Theoretical max range between lower and upper output limits (may include distortion or nonlinear regions) |
| **Usable/Linear Output Swing** | The practical range over which the amplifier maintains linear operation and sufficient gain |

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Theoretical Steps to Compute Output Swing**

#### **1\. Perform a DC Sweep of Input Voltage**

-   Sweep input voltage $V_{\text{in}}$ across its operating range.
    
-   Record corresponding output voltage $V_{\text{out}}$.
    

#### **2\. Compute Small-Signal Gain**

-   From the DC sweep data, approximate the **gain** as:
    

$$
A_v = \frac{dV_{\text{out}}}{dV_{\text{in}}}
$$

-   In dB:
    

$$
A_v(\text{dB}) = 20 \cdot \log_{10}\left|\frac{dV_{\text{out}}}{dV_{\text{in}}}\right|
$$

#### **3\. Define Reference Gain at Midpoint**

-   Choose a reference input voltage, often $V_{\text{in}} = V_{\text{DD}} / 2$, where the gain is typically highest.
    
-   Let the gain at this point be $A_{v,\text{mid}}$.
    

#### **4\. Define a Gain Threshold**

-   Define a gain threshold (e.g., 80% of mid gain):
    

$$
A_{v,\text{threshold}} = 0.8 \cdot A_{v,\text{mid}}
$$

#### **5\. Identify Linear Output Range**

-   Find all regions in the DC sweep where gain $A_v \ge A_{v,\text{threshold}}$.
    
-   Record the corresponding output voltages in this region.
    

#### **6\. Compute Output Swing**

-   Let:
    
    -   $V_{\text{out}}^{\text{max}}$: maximum output voltage in linear region
        
    -   $V_{\text{out}}^{\text{min}}$: minimum output voltage in linear region
        

Then:

$$
\boxed{\text{Output Swing (OW)} = V_{\text{out}}^{\text{max}} - V_{\text{out}}^{\text{min}}}
$$

---

### üß† Example: Why Is This Important?

If an amplifier is powered by 1.8‚ÄØV supply, ideally you'd want the output to swing from near 0‚ÄØV to near 1.8‚ÄØV. But due to transistor saturation and cutoff, real swing might be from **0.2‚ÄØV to 1.6‚ÄØV**, or narrower when keeping linearity.

Output swing is crucial in:

-   **Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)**
    
-   **Signal amplifiers**
    
-   **Operational amplifiers**
    
-   **Low-voltage design** where every mV counts
    

---

### üîç Optional Considerations

-   **Load conditions**: Output swing depends on load resistance and capacitive load.
    
-   **Bias point**: Poor biasing can reduce usable swing.
    
-   **Technology limitations**: In submicron CMOS, headroom is small, so maximizing swing is a design goal.
    

---

Let me know if you want a mathematical derivation from MOSFET equations for output swing in a specific topology (e.g., common source, differential pair).

You: 

why vout\_first = output\_above\_threshold\[0\] # First value vout\_last = output\_above\_threshold\[-1\] # Last value can corresponding to V\_max and V\_min in the previous formula

ChatGPT: 

Great question ‚Äî you're asking why these two values:

```python
vout_first = output_above_threshold[0]  # First value
vout_last = output_above_threshold[-1]  # Last value
```

can be used as **$V_{\text{out}}^{\text{max}}$** and **$V_{\text{out}}^{\text{min}}$** in the output swing formula:

$$
\text{Output Swing} = V_{\text{out}}^{\text{max}} - V_{\text{out}}^{\text{min}}
$$

---

### ‚úÖ Why This Works (Assumption Behind It)

When the Python code does this:

```python
indices = np.where(gain > 0.8 * gain_mid)
output_above_threshold = output[indices]
```

‚Ä¶it selects **all output voltage values** from the DC sweep **where the gain is ‚â• 80% of the mid-band gain**. These values are stored in `output_above_threshold`.

Now, since the DC sweep was done with `Vin1` increasing **monotonically from 0 to 1.8‚ÄØV**, and assuming the amplifier is **monotonic** (i.e., `Vout` generally decreases or increases smoothly with `Vin1`), then:

-   `output_above_threshold[0]` corresponds to the **first (left-most) input** where gain was high enough
    
-   `output_above_threshold[-1]` corresponds to the **last (right-most) input** where gain was still high enough
    

So, within the valid gain region, those two outputs define the **boundaries** of the amplifier's linear output range.

---

### üß† But Wait ‚Äî Why Isn't It Sorted?

You're right to think this is a little indirect. Let's look deeper.

**More accurately:**

-   If `Vout` decreases as `Vin` increases (typical for an inverting amplifier), then:
    
    -   `vout_first` will be **higher** than `vout_last`
        
    -   So:
        
        $$
        \text{OW} = vout\_first - vout\_last = V_{\text{max}} - V_{\text{min}}
        $$
        
-   If `Vout` increases with `Vin`, you may have:
    
    -   `vout_first < vout_last`, and you might need to reverse the subtraction
        

In most analog amplifier cases (like a common-source amplifier), `Vout` **decreases** with `Vin`, so this logic works directly.

---

### ‚úÖ When This Assumption Breaks

This logic works **if the following are true**:

1.  **Monotonic DC transfer curve** ‚Äî no non-monotonic regions
    
2.  **Gain is computed accurately across the sweep**
    
3.  **Sweep step is small enough** to resolve regions precisely
    

Otherwise, a more rigorous approach would be:

```python
vout_max = np.max(output_above_threshold)
vout_min = np.min(output_above_threshold)
ow = vout_max - vout_min
```

Which is more general and guarantees:

$$
\boxed{\text{OW} = V_{\text{out}}^{\text{max}} - V_{\text{out}}^{\text{min}}}
$$

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

So, the reason this works:

```python
vout_first = output_above_threshold[0]
vout_last = output_above_threshold[-1]
ow = vout_first - vout_last
```

is based on:

-   The assumption that `output_above_threshold` spans a **monotonic segment** of the output transfer curve,
    
-   And that the first and last values in that array define the linear region's voltage limits.
    

But if you want a **robust and direction-independent** version, use:

```python
ow = np.max(output_above_threshold) - np.min(output_above_threshold)
```

Let me know if you'd like to modify the code accordingly or visualize the swing with a plot!

You: 

why Identify Linear Output Range can be done via Find all regions in the DC sweep where gain larger than A\_v, threshold

ChatGPT: 

Great question again! Let's unpack **why identifying the linear output range** can be done by finding all regions in the DC sweep **where the gain is larger than a threshold** (like 80% of the mid-band gain):

---

### ‚úÖ **Key Idea: Gain as a Proxy for Linearity**

In amplifiers, the **small-signal gain**:

$$
A_v = \frac{dV_{\text{out}}}{dV_{\text{in}}}
$$

is a measure of how sensitively the output responds to small changes in input ‚Äî essentially, how **linear and active** the amplifier is in that region.

So:

-   Where the gain is **high and relatively constant**, the amplifier is operating in its **linear region**.
    
-   Where the gain **drops sharply**, the amplifier is entering **nonlinear regions** ‚Äî like when transistors move out of saturation.
    

---

### üìâ What Happens in Nonlinear Regions?

At the extremes of the input voltage range:

-   **Transistors enter cutoff or triode region**
    
-   Output voltage starts **saturating** (clipping or flattening)
    
-   The gain $A_v \to 0$ or becomes nonlinear
    

This is **not useful for linear amplification**. So we exclude these regions.

---

### üéØ Why Use a Gain Threshold?

Using a threshold like:

$$
A_{v, \text{threshold}} = 0.8 \cdot A_{v,\text{mid}}
$$

lets us define the **usable linear region** as the range where:

-   The amplifier maintains at least 80% of its peak gain
    
-   The transfer curve is steep (meaning strong signal amplification)
    
-   The output is not yet saturating
    

This is a **practical engineering rule of thumb**. The choice of 80% is arbitrary but commonly used to balance **gain stability vs output range**.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary: Why It Works

You can identify the **linear output range** by finding where gain ‚â• threshold because:

1.  **Gain is a measure of linearity** ‚Äî higher gain typically means you're in the linear region.
    
2.  **Falling gain = saturation** ‚Äî drop in gain signals you're entering nonlinear zones.
    
3.  **Thresholding gain** lets you carve out a region where performance is still acceptable.
    

---

### üìå Analogy

Think of the DC transfer curve as a hill:

-   The **steep part** of the hill = high gain = linear region
    
-   The **flat parts** at the top and bottom = low gain = nonlinear or saturated regions
    
-   You define the useful part of the hill (linear output region) by keeping only where the slope (gain) is steep enough (above threshold)
    

---

Let me know if you'd like a visual explanation (e.g., DC curve plot with gain overlay) to drive this home!

You: 

why mid-rail 0.9v is where the gain is maximum?

ChatGPT: 

Great follow-up! You're asking: **why is the gain usually maximum at the mid-rail voltage (e.g., 0.9‚ÄØV in a 1.8‚ÄØV supply system)?**

The answer lies in the **operating point of transistors** and the **DC transfer characteristics** of amplifiers ‚Äî particularly **common-source** or **differential pair** circuits.

---

### ‚úÖ Let's break it down:

---

## üß† 1. **What is Mid-Rail?**

For a supply of $V_{\text{DD}} = 1.8\text{ V}$, the **mid-rail** is:

$$
V_{\text{mid}} = \frac{V_{\text{DD}}}{2} = 0.9\text{ V}
$$

This is the **center of the available voltage swing** range.

---

## üîç 2. **Why Is Gain Highest Near Mid-Rail?**

### Consider a **common-source amplifier**:

-   The small-signal gain is:
    

$$
A_v = -g_m \cdot R_{\text{out}}
$$

Where:

-   $g_m$ is the transconductance of the MOSFET
    
-   $R_{\text{out}}$ is the output resistance of the load
    

Now, $g_m \propto I_D$ and is highest when:

-   The transistor is in **strong inversion** (not cutoff or weak inversion)
    
-   The drain voltage is in the **middle of its saturation region** ‚Äî not too close to 0‚ÄØV or $V_{\text{DD}}$
    

### At mid-rail:

-   The MOSFETs (in both single-stage and differential designs) are in the **saturation region**
    
-   $g_m$ is **high and stable**
    
-   **Voltage headroom** is balanced between upper and lower swing limits
    
-   The amplifier has **maximum linear region** on both sides of the bias point
    

Thus, **gain is maximized** because:

-   You're far from the nonlinear regions (cutoff, triode)
    
-   Transistors have optimal overdrive and operate efficiently
    

---

## üìâ 3. What Happens at the Edges?

-   At **low input voltages** (e.g., $V_{\text{in}} \approx 0 \text{ V}$):
    
    -   Transistors might enter **cutoff**
        
    -   $g_m \to 0$
        
    -   Gain drops
        
-   At **high input voltages** (e.g., $V_{\text{in}} \approx 1.8 \text{ V}$):
    
    -   Transistors might enter **triode region**
        
    -   Output saturates
        
    -   Gain drops again
        

Hence, gain forms a **bell-shaped curve** with its **peak near mid-rail**.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Region | Transistor State | Gain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Low $V_{\text{in}}$ | Cutoff | Near zero |
| **Mid $V_{\text{in}}$** | Saturation (strong) | **Maximum** |
| High $V_{\text{in}}$ | Triode/saturation | Drops again |

So, **0.9‚ÄØV** is typically used as a reference in the code because it's where the gain is **usually highest**, and therefore the **best point to define the linear region threshold**.

---

If you're analyzing a different topology (e.g., folded cascode, current mirror output stage), let me know ‚Äî the mid-gain point might shift slightly, but the principle is similar.

You: 

give me the relevant equation to show why At mid-rail, g\_m is high and stable

ChatGPT: 

To show **why $g_m$ (transconductance)** is high and stable **at mid-rail**, we need to link:

1.  The **DC operating point** of the transistor to $g_m$, and
    
2.  Show that around mid-rail, the transistor operates in **saturation**, where $g_m$ is maximized and most linear.
    

Let‚Äôs go step by step.

---

## üß† 1. **MOSFET in Saturation Region**

For an NMOS operating in **saturation**, the drain current is:

$$
I_D = \frac{1}{2} \mu_n C_{\text{ox}} \frac{W}{D} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 = \frac{1}{2} k_n (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2
$$

Where:

-   $\mu_n$ is electron mobility
    
-   $C_{\text{ox}}$ is gate oxide capacitance per unit area
    
-   $W/D$ is the aspect ratio
    
-   $V_{TH}$ is threshold voltage
    
-   $k_n = \mu_n C_{\text{ox}} \frac{W}{D}$
    

---

## üìà 2. **Transconductance Equation $g_m$**

By definition:

$$
g_m = \frac{dI_D}{dV_{GS}} = k_n (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) = \sqrt{2k_n I_D}
$$

So:

-   $g_m$ increases with $V_{GS}$ (but only while in **saturation**)
    
-   It also increases with $I_D$
    

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è 3. **Why Mid-Rail Gives Stable $g_m$**

Now consider a **common-source amplifier** biased at mid-rail:

-   $V_{\text{out}} \approx \frac{V_{DD}}{2}$
    
-   This gives **maximum output swing** in both directions before saturation
    
-   The transistor is in **deep saturation**, not close to triode or cutoff
    
-   $I_D$ is at a moderate-to-high level ‚Üí so $g_m$ is **strong and stable**
    

If the input $V_{in} \approx V_{GS}$ drifts far from this midpoint:

-   $I_D \to 0$ (cutoff), so $g_m \to 0$
    
-   or transistor enters triode ‚Üí gain drops again
    

Thus, at mid-rail:

$$
g_m = \sqrt{2 k_n I_D}
$$

-   $I_D$ is steady
    
-   $V_{GS}$ is in the optimal range
    
-   $g_m$ is high and relatively flat (small change in $V_{GS}$ ‚Üí stable $g_m$)
    

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Equation Chain

$$
\text{At mid-rail:} \quad V_{\text{GS}} \approx \text{bias point} \Rightarrow I_D \text{ is high} \Rightarrow g_m = \sqrt{2k_n I_D} \text{ is high and stable}
$$

---

## üß™ Optional: For Differential Pair

In a **differential pair** with tail current $I_{\text{tail}}$, the total current splits between two NMOS transistors.

Each branch's small-signal transconductance:

$$
g_m = \frac{\partial I_D}{\partial V_{in}} = \frac{I_{\text{tail}}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{V_{OV}} \quad \text{(around balance point)}
$$

At the **midpoint**, both sides are conducting equally ‚Üí linear and symmetric response ‚Üí maximum $g_m$.

---

## üîã Why Does Mid-Rail Matter?

Let‚Äôs say you're doing a **DC sweep** of an input voltage $V_{\text{in}}$ from 0‚ÄØV to 1.8‚ÄØV. This input controls the **gate** of your NMOS.

-   The **drain current $I_D$** is a function of $V_{GS} = V_{\text{in}} - V_S$ (assuming source is grounded).
    
-   The output voltage $V_{\text{out}} = V_D$ will be pulled down by this $I_D$ through a load (e.g., resistor or active load).
    

Now, we want to find where $I_D$ (and hence gain) is maximized.

---

### ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs analyze:

### Case 1: **Low $V_{\text{in}}$**

-   $V_{GS} \approx 0 \Rightarrow$ transistor **off** or in **weak inversion**
    
-   $I_D \approx 0 \Rightarrow g_m \approx 0$
    
-   Output = $V_{DD}$ (no current drop)
    
-   **Not useful**
    

---

### Case 2: **Very high $V_{\text{in}}$**

-   $V_{GS} \gg V_{TH} \Rightarrow$ transistor conducts **hard**
    
-   $I_D$ becomes large
    
-   $V_D$ (output) drops close to ground
    
-   But if $V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH} \Rightarrow$ transistor enters **triode** region
    
-   $I_D$ stops increasing quadratically ‚Üí **gain drops**
    

---

### ‚úÖ Case 3: **Mid $V_{\text{in}} \approx 0.9\,\text{V}$**

-   $V_{GS}$ is large enough for **saturation**
    
-   $V_D$ is high enough to **stay in saturation**
    
-   $I_D$ is high, and increasing with $V_{GS}$
    
-   Output $V_D \approx 0.9\,\text{V} \Rightarrow$ maximum headroom in both directions
    
-   **This is the ideal linear region**:
    
    -   High $I_D$
        
    -   High $g_m$
        
    -   Output not clipped
        
    -   MOSFET in strong inversion & saturation
        

---

## üéØ Why Does This Maximize Gain?

From earlier:

$$
g_m = \frac{dI_D}{dV_{GS}} = \sqrt{2k_n I_D}
$$

-   So when $I_D$ is **high and increasing**, $g_m$ is also high
    
-   This happens only when:
    
    -   $V_{GS}$ is sufficiently large
        
    -   $V_{DS}$ is high enough to **keep the transistor in saturation**
        

That condition is met when:

-   $V_{\text{in}} \approx 0.9\,\text{V}$
    
-   $V_{\text{out}} \approx 0.9\,\text{V}$
    
-   Which is why the **gain peaks at mid-rail**

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Condition | $V_{GS}$ | $I_D$ | $g_m$ | Region |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low $V_{\text{in}}$ | Too small | Near 0 | Near 0 | Cutoff |
| **Mid $V_{\text{in}}$** | Optimal (bias point) | High, rising | **High** | **Saturation** |
| High $V_{\text{in}}$ | Very large | Very high | Decreasing | Triode |

So:  
‚û°Ô∏è **At mid-rail**, the transistor is in the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù of operation:  
‚û°Ô∏è **Strong saturation**, **high $I_D$**, and **maximum gain**.
