This function, `compute_bandwidth`, is used in **analog circuit design** to **automatically extract the bandwidth**  ($f_{BW}$) of an amplifier from a **frequency sweep simulation** (AC analysis) done using **NGSpice**. Let's break down how it works and why it's relevant:

## üì° **Purpose in Analog Design**

In analog design, one key performance metric for amplifiers is the **bandwidth**, typically defined as the range of frequencies over which the amplifier maintains its gain within 3 dB of the maximum (the **‚Äì3 dB bandwidth**). This tells you how fast or wideband your amplifier is.

NGSpice can perform an **AC analysis**, sweeping input frequencies and calculating output voltages. The log file saved from this simulation contains frequency points and the complex voltage at some output node(s). This function parses that output to find the ‚Äì3 dB bandwidth.

## üîç **What the Function Does**

### 1\. **Reads the AC simulation output**

```python
data_ac = np.genfromtxt(logfile, skip_header=1)
```

-   Assumes a log file (e.g., CSV or whitespace-separated) with rows like:
    
    ```scss
    freq  real(v(out))  imag(v(out))   [maybe more columns]
    ```
    
-   Skips the header and loads the data into a NumPy array.
    

---

### 2\. **Parses complex output voltage**

```python
v_d = data_ac[:, 1] + 1j * data_ac[:, 2]
```

-   Combines real and imaginary parts of the output voltage.
    
-   Computes the **magnitude in dB** using:
    
    ```python
    output = 20 * np.log10(v_d)
    ```
    
    This gives the gain at each frequency point.
    
-   The **maximum gain** is assumed to occur at the first frequency point:
    
    ```python
    gain = 20 * np.log10(np.abs(v_d[0]))
    ```
- This assumption is valid, because we use the following AC simulation command, so at 1 Hz, the gain is maximum.
    ```spice
    .control
    ac dec 10 1 10G        
    wrdata output_ac.dat {output_nodes_str} 
    .endc
    ```    

---

### 3\. **Computes ‚Äì3 dB gain threshold**

```python
half_power_point = gain - 3
```

This defines the gain level where bandwidth ends.

---

### 4\. **Finds frequency range where gain ‚â• (max - 3 dB)**

```python
indices = np.where(output >= half_power_point)[0]
```

-   Finds all frequency points where the output gain is still within 3 dB of the peak.
    
-   The **lowest and highest frequencies** in this range are:
    
    ```python
    f_l = frequency[indices[0]]
    f_h = frequency[indices[-1]]
    ```
    
-   Then computes the bandwidth as:
    
    ```python
    bandwidth = f_h - f_l
    ```
    

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This assumes a **flat passband** followed by a sharp roll-off (common in amplifiers). For peaky responses, this method may overestimate bandwidth.

## üß† **Design Insight**

This function helps automate **post-processing of simulation results**, which is especially useful in:

-   Circuit optimization workflows
    
-   Parametric sweeps
    
-   Multi-topology comparison
    
-   ML-based sizing or design space exploration
    

Rather than manually inspecting Bode plots, this function allows **programmatic measurement** of bandwidth, which is a step toward **automated analog design**.

## ‚úÖ When to Use

Use this function when:

-   You run an NGSpice AC sweep on an amplifier circuit.
    
-   You log output voltages vs frequency (real + imaginary).
    
-   You want to calculate the bandwidth automatically from the simulation data.
